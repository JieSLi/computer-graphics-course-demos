# Computer Graphics Course Demos

This repository contains 3D graphics demonstrations. 

## Projects

### Project 1: Barn Field Interactive Scene (Three.js)

An interactive 3D scene featuring a green grassy field, a barn, and a tree. The scene includes a blue player character that can be controlled using keyboard input for movement. This project demonstrates 3D graphics programming using the Three.js library, a popular JavaScript 3D graphics framework.

**Deployed on GitHub Pages:** [https://jiesli.github.io/computer-graphics-course-demos/barn_field_interact_3js/](https://jiesli.github.io/computer-graphics-course-demos/barn_field_interact_3js/)

### Project 2: Barn Field Interactive Scene (WebGL2)

A preliminary reimplementation of the same interactive 3D scene using WebGL2, providing a lower-level approach to 3D graphics rendering. This project demonstrates direct WebGL2 programming, including shader management, geometry handling, and matrix transformations, while maintaining the same visual elements and interactive controls as Project 1.

**Deployed on GitHub Pages:** [https://jiesli.github.io/computer-graphics-course-demos/barn_field_interact_webgl2/](https://jiesli.github.io/computer-graphics-course-demos/barn_field_interact_webgl2/)

## Features

Both projects feature:
- **Interactive 3D Environment**: A scenic outdoor setting with a grassy field
- **3D Objects**: Barn and tree models
- **Player Character**: Blue player avatar with keyboard-controlled movement
- **Real-time Rendering**: Smooth 3D graphics rendered in the browser
